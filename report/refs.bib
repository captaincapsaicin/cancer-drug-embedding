abstract = {In this article, we propose a family of efficient kernels for large graphs with discrete node labels. Key to our method is a rapid feature extraction scheme based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism on graphs. It maps the original graph to a sequence of graphs, whose node attributes capture topological and label information. A family of kernels can be defined based on this Weisfeiler-Lehman sequence of graphs, including a highly efficient kernel comparing subtree-like patterns. Its runtime scales only linearly in the number of edges of the graphs and the length of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph sequence. In our experimental evaluation, our kernels outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several graph classification benchmark data sets in terms of accuracy and runtime. Our kernels open the door to large-scale applications of graph kernels in various disciplines such as computational biology and social network analysis.},

UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

@article{Le2014,
abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

@article{Narayanan,
abstract = {Recent works on representation learning for graph struc-tured data predominantly focus on learning distributed representations of graph substructures such as nodes and sub-graphs. However, many graph analytics tasks such as graph classification and clustering require representing entire graphs as fixed length feature vectors. While the afore-mentioned approaches are naturally unequipped to learn such representations, graph kernels remain as the most effective way of obtaining them. However, these graph kernels use handcrafted features (e.g., shortest paths, graphlets, etc.) and hence are hampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec's embeddings are learnt in an un-supervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence, they could be used for any downstream task such as graph classification, clustering and even seeding supervised representation learning approaches. Our experiments on several benchmark and large real-world datasets show that graph2vec achieves significant improvements in classification and clustering accuracies over substructure representation learning approaches and are competitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels.},

abstract = {We present a probabilistic modeling framework and adaptive sampling algorithm wherein unsupervised generative models are combined with black box predictive models to tackle the problem of input design. In input design, one is given one or more stochastic "oracle" predictive functions, each of which maps from the input design space (e.g. DNA sequences or images) to a distribution over a property of interest (e.g. protein fluorescence or image content). Given such stochastic oracles, the problem is to find an input that is expected to maximize one or more properties, or to achieve a specified value of one or more properties, or any combination thereof. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach substantially outperforms other recently presented methods for tackling a specific version of this problem, namely, maximization when the oracle is assumed to be deterministic and unbiased. We also demonstrate that our method can tackle more general versions of the problem.},

@article{Gomez-Bombarelli2018,
abstract = {We report a method to convert discrete representations of molecules to and from a multidimensional continuous representation. This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and also in the set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.},

@techreport{Fukuyama2017,
abstract = {When working with large biological data sets, exploratory analysis is an important first step for understanding the latent structure and for generating hypotheses to be tested in subsequent analyses. However, when the number of variables is large compared to the number of samples, standard methods such as principal components analysis give results which are unstable and difficult to interpret. To mitigate these problems, we have developed a method which allows the analyst to incorporate side information about the relationships between the variables in a way that encourages similar variables to have similar loadings on the principal axes. This leads to a low-dimensional representation of the samples which both describes the latent structure and which has axes which are interpretable in terms of groups of closely related variables. The method is derived by putting a prior encoding the relationships between the variables on the data and following through the analysis on the posterior distributions of the samples. We show that our method does well at reconstructing true latent structure in simulated data and we also demonstrate the method on a dataset investigating the effects of antibiotics on the composition of bacteria in the human gut.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a major public health crisis, and finding new sources of antimicrobial drugs is crucial to solving it. Bacteriocins, which are bacterially-produced antimicrobial peptide products, are candidates for broadening our pool of antimicrobials. The discovery of new bacteriocins by genomic mining is hampered by their sequences' low complexity and high variance, which frustrates sequence similarity-based searches. Here we use word embeddings of protein sequences to represent bacteriocins, and subsequently apply Recurrent Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines to predict novel bacteriocins from protein sequences without using sequence similarity. We developed a word embedding method that accounts for sequence order, providing a better classification than a simple summation of the same word embeddings. We use the Uniprot/TrEMBL database to acquire the word embeddings taking advantage of a large volume of unlabeled data. Our method predicts, with a high probability, six yet unknown putative bacteriocins in Lactobacillus. Generalized, the representation of sequences with word embeddings preserving sequence order information can be applied to protein classification problems for which sequence homology cannot be used.},

abstract = {We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93{\%}+-0.06{\%} is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8{\%} accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0{\%} accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined.},
